Recommendations to Follow ->

1. There is no default return types of methods in java. In java it is compulsory to write return type.
2. There is default access specifier for all the method and class. that is "default", by default it is not public
3. Write methods with return statement wherever possible.
4. Do not write any business logic in public static void main
5. You can create objects in any method. It is not only psvm where you create objects. - Recommendation
6. Do not write any business logic without any method. - Rule
7. Method name should have the task connected with some nouns - Recommendation
8. Do not create unnecessary local variables. There are termed as 'code smells'. This blocks code optmizations.
9. Class name should start with capital.
10. method name 
11. Constructor don't create object but they are used to initlize objects or data member.





For every class there is cosmic super class. Name of cosmic superclass is "Object".
class Dog .... extends Object




-Rules of Method of Override
1. Method signature should be same
2. return type should be same or covariant e.g - 
3. cannot have restrictve access specifer
4. cannot change arguments
5. There cannot be broder exception
6. Final method cannot be overriden


- Abstract class
1. Abstract class cannot be instatained
2. Abstract class can contain all the method as abstract or none of the methods as abstract
3. Abstract class can contain constructor
4. Can contain the data member and member functions as well
5. You need to extend abstract class


-Interface
1. Interface is by default abstract class with some speical behaviour
2. All the methods by default public and abstract
3. Cannot contain any data member, can contain static constatant
4. it Cannot contain consturctor
5. You need to implement interface.
6. We can implement more than one interface.
7. Interface can extend another interface.
