What do you mean by handling the exception ?
- Handling exception is not Rectifying exception 
- Your program should not abruptly
- The other parts of program which are not connected with exception, should not get impacted
- If exception occurs it should gracefully handled with proper error messages


Types of exceptions :
- checked exceptions -> Are checked at compile time. Developer is forced to write the code in exception handling block.
- unchecked exceptions -> Checked at runtime. Writing the exception handling block is optional. 

How to handle it :
- Put the suspicies or doubtful code in the try block and followed by that add the catch block to catch the specific exception. you are expecting by your code.


Cascading of Excepitons :
 - Where single block of try can generate multiple exceptions
 

- We can use another try catch block inside a try block.

- Anytime you are working with resources it is forced by checked exception. Because it is not in hand of programmer that file will be correct.
- whenever you are using resources out of jvm.
